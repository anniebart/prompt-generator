# prompt-generator
in need of a prompt for a creative coding project? Never fear, prompt generator is here!


During my time at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), I first joined, then later led, the creative coding group. While I love creative problem solving and making fun applications, sometimes it can be hard to get started. When the possibilities are endless, where do you begin? We looked at some examples of prompt generators that gave users ideas for creative coding or design projects. I thought it would be fun to create own prompt generator - a sort of meta project- styled after the terminal using commands to give users prompts I've scraped from a few creative coding/project sites. 

Currently there are only a handful of commands (working on adding more to build out a more robust application). 
> `man prompt generate` 

(to give you the man page)

> `prompt generate`

(to give you a single prompt)
> `clear`

(to clear the terminal)
